# **Autocompletion System for Previously Written Sentences**

## **Overview**
This project is a local-first autocompletion system that suggests previously written sentences by a user as replacements for their current sentence. Unlike traditional text generation, this system does not generate new completions but retrieves and ranks past user-written sentences based on similarity. The system operates in real-time, dynamically embedding and storing sentences as the user types within a document.

## **Functionality**
1. **Real-Time Sentence Capture**  
   - Detect when a user completes or modifies a sentence.
   - Embed and store sentences dynamically as they are written.
   - Optionally track sentence positions for context-aware suggestions.
2. **Retrieve Similar Sentences**  
   - As the user types a new sentence, convert it to a vector in real-time.
   - Search for the most similar past sentences in the vector database.
3. **Suggest Alternatives**  
   - Present top-ranked past sentences as inline replacements.
   - Apply similarity filtering to ensure high-quality matches.

## **Design Model**
The system is based on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** principles but focuses only on retrieval. The key steps are:
1. **Sentence Embedding**
   - Convert sentences into numerical vectors using an embedding model.
   - Store both the sentence and its vector representation in a database.
2. **Vector Storage & Search**
   - Store sentence embeddings in a local vector database.
   - Use efficient similarity search (e.g., FAISS) to retrieve the closest matches.
   - Ensure incremental updates so new sentences are indexed dynamically.
3. **Query Processing**
   - Embed the userâ€™s current sentence as they type.
   - Search the database for similar past sentences.
   - Rank results and filter out low-similarity matches.
4. **Return Suggestions**
   - Present the most relevant past sentences as replacement options in real-time.

## **Libraries & Tools**
Each component requires specific libraries for efficient processing:

### **1. Sentence Embedding**  
Convert text into high-dimensional vectors:
- `sentence-transformers` (Hugging Face) - Efficient transformer-based embeddings.
- `OpenAI API` (`text-embedding-ada-002`) - Cloud-based embedding service (optional).

Example:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
vector = model.encode("I love hiking in the mountains.")
```

### **2. Vector Storage & Retrieval**  
Efficiently store and search sentence embeddings:
- `FAISS` - Local high-performance similarity search.
- `Annoy` (Spotify) - Approximate nearest neighbor search.
- `Weaviate / Qdrant` - Open-source vector databases (optional for scalability).

Example using FAISS:
```python
import faiss, numpy as np
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(384)
index.add(np.random.rand(100, 384).astype('float32'))
```

### **3. Query Processing & Retrieval**  
Compare new sentences with stored ones:
- `numpy` - Efficient numerical processing.
- `scipy.spatial` - Distance computations for similarity scoring.

Example similarity search:
```python
query_vector = model.encode("I enjoy trekking in the hills.").astype('float32')
D, I = index.search(np.array([query_vector]), k=3)
```

### **4. Ranking & Filtering**  
Ensure retrieved results are relevant:
- **Relevance Thresholding** - Set a minimum similarity score.
- **Metadata Filtering** - Use timestamps or sentence positions for better ranking.
- **Re-ranking (Optional)** - Use a lightweight LLM for ranking quality.

### **5. Incremental Updates**  
Store new sentences dynamically:
- Append new sentences to a local database (e.g., SQLite, JSON, or CSV).
- Update the FAISS index in real-time to reflect newly written sentences.

## **Next Steps**
- Implement a local text editor integration for real-time testing.
- Optimize retrieval ranking for better accuracy.
- Extend to an API-based implementation when ready.
